    <h1>My Current Antics</h1>

    <p>
    Currently I am working as a research assistant at The Fields Institute
    under the supervision of <a href="https://math.mcmaster.ca/~haskell/" target="_blank">Dr.
      Deirdre Haskell</a>. We are looking at the model theory of analytic
    functions, loosely following what is outlined in her paper <a 
    href="https://www.math.mcmaster.ca/%7Ehaskell/papers/ASL-survey-analytic.pdf" 
    Target="_blank">Model Theory Of Analytic Functions: Some Historical
    Comments</a> and going further in depth on each relevant historical
    paper. Some of the papers we have looked at so far:
    <ul>
      <li>Denef and van den Dries</li>
      <li>Lipshitz</li>
      <li>Cluckers and Lipshitz</li>
      <li>One-Dimensional p-analytic subsets</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p> In addition to the above I am beginning my applications to Graduate
    school where I am looking to continue my studies in Mathematics. While my
    current interests largely lie in model theory I am interested in many
    different areas of mathematics including:

    <ul>
      <li>(Cellular) Automata</li>
      <li>Low-Dimensional and Algebraic Topology (including Knot Theory) and</li>
      <li>Computability and Complexity Theory</li>
    </ul>

    That being said I truly just enjoy mathematics and look forward to seeing
    where this journey will take me.
